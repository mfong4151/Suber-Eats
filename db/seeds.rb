#1. table: accepts an array version of your table that corresponds to the name. 
    #Your table MUST be formated as an array containing multiple hashes, see the example from my menu_items class
    ##Because of how this is set up, the variable name MUST be equivalent to the name of the table in migrations

#2. class_name, accepts the actual class name of your migration table. That's right, pass a class in as an argument.
    ##Named not according to convention in order to enhance readability

#3. table_string table name as a as string. refers to the table you want to destroy on   ApplicationRecord.connection.reset_pk_sequence!('') 
    ##Someone else can do the hard work of finding a way to get rid of this variable
